# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Installation and Execution

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url> (Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)

Navigate into the project directory:

cd ToDoList (Make sure you cd into the root of your Vite project where package.json is located.)

Install dependencies:

npm install

or

yarn

or

pnpm install

Run the application in development mode:

To start the development server and run the application in your browser:

npm run dev

or

yarn dev

or

pnpm dev

This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173/ (Vite's default port, though it might vary).
